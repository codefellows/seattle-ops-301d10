# Lab Submission Instructions

## Before You Begin

### Visualize the Assignment

Evaluate the lab requirements and begin by drawing a picture, topology, or flow chart if you can.  Having a solid visual understanding of what you have/need and how it connects is critical to properly approaching this assignment.

### Break Down the Assignment

Once you have a good visual and mental model of how the system works, break down the requirements. For each requirement, ask yourself the following questions:

- What kind of setup do I need? Do I need to wait for a large .ova or .iso file to download before I can even start? Do I have a fresh VM or do I should I reuse one from a previous lab?
- What is the outcome I need to achieve, and should I document it? Are there specific deliverables (pieces of information, screenshots, code, explanations) which I need to provide?
- What parts of the lab are dependent on each other? If I get stuck on one part, what other parts of the assignment can I keep working on?

**Map your priorities and dependencies before jumping into the work.**

## Common Lab Setup & Submission Instructions

### Getting Started

- Make a new Google Doc and title it with the course code and assignment (i.e `ops-201d7: Lab 07 - OS Upgrade and Remote Access`)
- **Add your name and the date at the top of the document.**
- Look through the lab and highlight:
  - Each setup requirement (VMs, software, online accounts).
  - Each deliverable.
- If a script is required as part of the lab, create a new repo in GitHub, and link to it in your Google Doc.
  > _If the script is only a line or two, you may opt to include just a screenshot or the copy-pasted code in the Google Doc, but if in doubt then include a Github link._
- Submit a link which gives the grader "**Commenter**" access. This way we can leave comments on specific parts of the lab, which should make it easier for you to respond to us and make corrections.

### Create a Professional Product

When you are writing your labs, imagine that an employer might see them.

**Follow these guidelines to create professional looking documents:**

- **Visually distinguish your contribution from the lab text.** You can use a distinctly different font, highlighting, text color, or style, just keep it professional (no comic sans, stick to standard colors).
- **Write in full sentences.**
- **Avoid profanity.**
- **Use bullet points to avoid walls of text.**
- **Include a caption for every picture.** Even if the context feels obvious to you now, it might not be to the person reading/grading it.
- **Group your screenshots, explanations, and comments alongside the lab text they respond too.** Don't place all your work in a jumble _after_ a section of the lab you were working on.

### Corrections and Resubmits

- Look for comments left by the grader, and make corrections or respond to them as appropriate.
- Ask your instructor how to alert the grader when you are ready to have the assignment re-graded.
