# Ops Challenge: Conditionals in Menu Systems

## Overview

Conditionals allow us to program a process to react differently based on various object states. A conditional statement will make use of the IF, THEN keywords to trigger actions in the script depending on whether the test was passed. Conditionals are highly useful in evaluating user input, and thereby letting us setup responsive menu systems in our tooling.

## Creating a Menu in Bash

Creating a menu system using Bash involves writing a script that presents the user with a set of options to choose from and then executes corresponding actions based on their choice. This can be useful for automating tasks, managing system configurations, or providing an interactive interface for your Bash scripts.

A well-designed menu system should provide a user-friendly way to interact with a script. Here are some features that a menu system might have:

**Clear Display:** The menu should be visually clear and easy to read. Each option should be labeled and numbered, and there should be a clear indication of how the user can make selections.

**User Guidance:** Provide brief descriptions or hints for each menu option to help users understand what each option does. This helps users make informed choices.

**Interactive Input:** Users should be able to make selections using intuitive input methods. This often involves using numerical choices or alphabetical characters.

**Error Handling:** The menu system should gracefully handle invalid or unexpected user inputs. It should display error messages and guide users to correct their input.

**Navigation:** Users should be able to easily navigate between menu options. This can include going back to a previous menu, moving forward, or returning to the main menu.

**Exit Option:** Provide a clear and easily accessible option for users to exit the menu system. This is especially important to prevent users from feeling trapped within the menu.

**Feedback and Confirmation:** After users make selections, provide clear feedback that confirms their choice. This helps avoid confusion and ensures users understand the action they've initiated.

**Help or Information:** Include an option to display additional information, instructions, or a help menu that explains how to use the menu system or what each option does.

**Consistency:** Maintain a consistent layout and design throughout the menu system. Consistency helps users become familiar with the interface and reduces the learning curve.

**Scalability:** Design the menu system to handle a growing number of options without becoming cluttered or confusing. This might involve organizing options into categories or using sub-menus.

**Testing:** Thoroughly test the menu system to ensure that all options and functionalities work as intended. Try to anticipate different user scenarios and edge cases.

**Documentation:** If the menu system is part of a larger program or script, provide documentation that explains how to use the menu system, what each option does, and any related information.

**User Experience:** Strive to create a smooth and pleasant user experience. The menu system should be intuitive, efficient, and designed with the user's needs in mind.
