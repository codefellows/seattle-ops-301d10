# IT Project Management

![Image](/ops-301-guide/curriculum/class-12/slides/assets/11_09.png)

NOTE:

### Why

- Why do we care about project management in an Ops class?
  - These ideas may help your team stay organized as you enter project week
  - If you're looking at any kind of systems administration role, you should consider picking up qualifications and experience 
    related to project management. This can be a competitive edge in the job hunt!
 
### What


- What frameworks allow IT teams to operate effectively and at scale?
  - ITIL framework
    - Good resource for reference: Wiki IT Process Maps
    - Four dimensions model
      - ITIL 4 defines four dimensions that should be considered to ensure a holistic approach to service management:
        - Organizations and people
        - Information and technology
        - Partners and suppliers
        - Value streams and processes
 
    - Service value system
      - The service value System (SVS) represents "how all the components and activities of an organization work together to 
        facilitate value creation". The ITIL 4 SVS includes several elements:
        - Guiding principles
          - Recommendations that guide an organization in all circumstances, regardless of changes in its goals, strategies, type 
            of work or management structure
        - Governance
          - The means by which an organization is directed and controlled
        - Service value chain
          - A set of interconnected activities that an organization performs to deliver a valuable product/service to its customers
        - Continual improvement practices
          - Recurring organizational activity that takes place at all levels to make sure that stakeholders' expectations are met
 
- What is Agile project management?
    - Agile is a philosophy that advocates for the incremental and evolutionary delivery of outputs instead of revolutionary one 
      and encourages the iterative revisiting of project stages.
      - Benefits
        - Faster deployment life cycle
        - Predictable schedule (sprints)
        - Customer-focused approach
        - Flexibility
        - Team empowerment
        - Promotes effective communication
 
    - Waterfall is the traditional project management approach where stages are marked complete and not revisited.
 
### How

- CompTIA Project+
- Agile-related credentials and experience
- PMP (advanced, experienced PMs only)

# IT Infrastructure

<div>

<div align="left">

- A workgroup is decentralized and does not answer to a singular authority
  - Peer-to-peer (P2P)
  - Default of Win 10 out the box
  - Easy to deploy but config varies
- A domain is a network of computers that all answer to a singular authority
  - A domain style network is a form of client-server architecture
  - Standard best practice design
  - â€¦but potentially single point of failure

</div>

<div align="left">


![Image](/ops-301-guide/curriculum/class-12/slides/assets/11_12d.png)
<!-- .element style="width: 85%"-->


</div>

</div>

NOTE:

 What infrastructure designs are scalable and centrally administered?

### Workgroup vs Domain
- A workgroup is decentralized and does not answer to a singular authority
  - This style of network is P2P (peer-to-peer)
  - This is the default configuration of a Windows 10 PC out of box
  - Quick and easy to deploy, but configurations between computers will vary greatly
- A domain is a network of computers that all answer to a singular authority
  - A domain style network is a form of client-server architecture
  - To be joined to a domain, a Windows 10 PC must not be Home edition; typically, Pro is recommended
  - More work to setup and deploy, but configurations will be consistent across computers
  - Domain is recommended for most businesses more than a handful of computers
  - Support for centralized management of user profiles and computer configurations
  - Disadvantage: Single point of failure from a security perspective. Discuss why.

# RAID
Increase data redundancy and/or improve performance

<div>

<div align="left" style="font-size: 27px">

**RAID** (**Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks**):
- A **data storage virtualization technology** that maps multiple physical disks to a single "drive"
- **Mirrored disks** are **failover real-time copies** of each other
  - Creates redundancy
- **Striped disks** depend on each other for optimal performance but aren't clones
- Learn RAID 0, 1, and 5 for starters -- Study!
- **RAID provides High Availability (HA), but is NOT a backup!**

</div>

<div align="left">


![Image](/ops-301-guide/curriculum/class-12/slides/assets/11_08.png)
<!-- .element style="width: 100%"-->

</div>

</div>

NOTE:

- RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) is a data storage virtualization technology that utilizes multiple physical disk drives to increase data redundancy and/or improve performance.
  - View the raid chart at [RAID LEVELS INTRO FOR BEGINNERS: PROS, CONS, AND  
    TECHNIQUES](https://ttrdatarecovery.com/raid-levels/) for a visual comparison of the RAID types
  - RAID Types
      - RAID 0 - stripes data across multiple drives
      - RAID 1 - takes all data and mirrors it to a second drive
      - RAID 5 - uses parity to provide redundancy, can rebuild data if one drive fails
- More CPU and RAM storage on deck per server blade
- In a business, tend to be stored in a dedicated fireproofed electrical room
- In a home, somewhere cool and separated like a closet or garage
 
- What hardware specs should I look for in a server?
  - Similar to desktop components
  - Look for high CPU and RAM; redundant drives great to find
  - Depends on the purpose
 
> Yes you can totally deploy enterprise-grade equipment at home, just keep an eye on that power bill!
 
# HOW

 
- How can we transition from workgroup P2P to client-server architecture?
  - Need to deploy Windows Server 2019 to the LAN
  - This server will host authoritative services that "take charge" of the Windows 10 computers

# Domain Controller

<div>

<div align="left">

- Why study domains and DCs in 301?
  - Systems administrator VS adversaries can use the same tools to achieve objectives
    - Adversary: Why reinvent the wheel? I'll just take over the DC
    - Admin: I need these tools to do my job
  - DCs are essential to managing endpoints at scale

# DNS at Internet Level

<div>

<div align="left" style="font-size: 28px">

- A DNS Server maintains a local database of IP addresses associated with domain names
  - Acts in hierarchy with other DNS servers, all the way up to root DNS
  - Top level domains (TLDs) are domains in the DNS root zone of the internet's DNS
    - Example: *.com
    - Maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
  - Public DNS, e.g. Google DNS at 8.8.8.8
  - Private DNS, e.g. your LAN's DC

# DNS Resolution Process

<div>

<div align="left">

- A DNS forward lookup zone converts a domain name to an IP address or another name
- A DNS reverse lookup zone converts an IP address to a domain name
- A fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) is written with the host name, the domain name, then the TLD name. Examples:
  - www.microsoft.com
  - en.wikipedia.org
  - p301srv03.timandtombreadco.us

</div>

NOTE:

# WHAT 

- What are the components of the DNS resolution process? 
  - DNS Resolver 
    - Receives the request to resolve the domain name with the IP address 
    - This server does the grunt work in figuring out where the site you want to go actually resides on the internet 
  - Root Server 
    - Receives the first request and returns a result to let the DNS resolver know what the address of the TLD server that stores the information about the site 
    - TLD is the equivalent of the .com or .net portion of the domain name 
  - TLD Server
    - Dns resolver then queries this server, which returns the Authoritative Name Server where the site is actually returned 
  - Authoritative Name Server 
    - Finally, the DNS resolver queries this server to learn the actual IP address of the website you are trying to deliver

<div align="left">

- Client makes a lookup request for Server1 DNS Suffix is appended to the request IF a FQDN is not used, in this instance a short name is used and the suffix MyDomain.Net is appended then sent to the clients DNS Server
- DNS Server checks to see if it hosts a primary forward lookup zone for MyDomain.Net if it does not have a record it will check its Conditional Forwarders.

- If the Conditional Forwarder is found it will send the request to that DNS Server that's specified.
- If the DNS Server specified in the conditional forwarder does not respond then the DNS Server will send the request for its Forwarder
- The request hits the DNS server specified in the forwarders tab of the DNS server, the request hits 8.8.8.8 which then replies with the IP address
